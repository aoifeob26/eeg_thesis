Abstract 

Background: 

Alcoholism can be associated as a catalyst for cognitive decline and altered brain function, however detecting consistent neural markers is considered challenging. Electroencephalography (EEG) provides a non-invasive method to measure brain activity using precise time measurements whilst offering a non-invasive method to help explore the presented differences. Many EEG studies tend to rely heavily on average responses/peak amplitudes which discards imperative information about how the brain’s response changes over time.  

Aims: 

This study investigates whether differences in EEG signal shape can distinguish alcoholic from control participants, using a data-driven approach that captures the full temporal structure of the signals. 

Methods: 

We applied Functional Data Analysis (FDA) to given EEG signals collected from alcoholic and control participants who took part in various visual stimuli related tasks. We represented the EEG signals as smooth continuous curves to preserve their temporal shape. Functional Principal Component Analysis (FPCA) to extract key patterns in variation. These key patterns, otherwise known as components, were utilised during clustering and classification, testing whether EEG shape alone can distinguish between the subject identifiers (alcohols or controls). 

Expected Outcomes: 

We expect to find that group differences in EEG signals are most pronounced during unexpected stimuli conditions, for example the S2 No-Match task. These findings would reflect an altered cognitive processing in alcoholics. We also anticipate that FPCA components when used with machine learning classifiers, eg random forests, will offer a moderate to strong predicative performance in distinguishing group status based solely on EEG signal shape.

Introduction 

Context: 

Alcohol use disorder (AUD) has been linked to impairments in cognitive control, attention, and stimulus processing. Individuals with AUD often show deficits in tasks requiring cognitive control and flexibility, these effects from changes are believed to have measurable neural correlates. EEG provides a non-invasive method of capturing brain activity with millisecond-level precision and is thus well-suited for studying cognitive processing in real-time. 

Why EEG? 

EEG offers several advantages for studying brain function: it is cost-effective, non-invasive, and highly sensitive to the rapid temporal dynamics of cognitive processes. This makes it an ideal tool for comparing brain responses between groups with subtle neurological differences, such as alcoholics and controls. 

Stimuli and Sensor Selection 

In this study, participants were exposed to three types of visual stimuli: 

S1 (Object): A single image, 

S2 Match: Two identical images, 

S2 No-Match: Two different images. 

These conditions were designed to test how the brain responds to repeated versus unexpected visual inputs.  

EEG signals were recorded using 64 electrodes across the scalp, but our analysis focused on two frontal sites: FP1 and FP2. These electrodes were chosen because frontal regions are closely associated with cognitive function, attention, and decision making, all of which are areas known to be affected by alcohol use. Focusing on FP1 and FP2 also helped reduce data complexity while still capturing meaningful differences in brain response. 

What Has Been Done Before: EEG Studies in Alcoholism Research  

There is a substantial amount of EEG research that have investigated cognitive dysfunction associated with alcohol use disorder. Many of these studies focus on event-related potentials (ERPs), which are averaged EEG responses that are time-locked to stimulus presentation. One commonly studied ERP is the ‘P300 component’, which typically appears 300 milliseconds after a rare/unexpected stimulus and reflects attention and stimulus evaluation processes. 

From previous studies there is a consistent patterns of participants with AUD showing a lower P300 amplitude, this would indicate weaker cognitive processing. A study example ‘Polish et al (1994)’ reported that the P300 responses for alcoholics were reported to be smaller during oddball tasks which would allude to reduced attention. Similarly ‘Porjesz and Begleiter (2003)’ reviewed ERP and suggested that a lower P300 may even reflect a genetic risk factor for alcoholism. 

Other studies (e.g. Kamarajan et al. 2006) 

have used the basic features of EEG signals by utilising findings such as average voltage, peak amplitudes and/or response time to compare alcoholics and non-alcoholics. These studies tend to focus on particular parts of the EEG signal, making the data easier to work with but in return losing a lot of time-related details. (Rangaswamy et al, 2007) 

Limitations of Prior Work 

Traditional EEG analysis techniques reduce complex, time-varying signals to single summary statistics. This approach risks oversimplifying the data—for instance, two signals might have the same peak amplitude but very different trajectories before and after the peak. Moreover, these methods often rely on assumptions like normality that may not hold. 

Very few studies have retained the full shape of EEG signals in their analyses, and even fewer have applied this approach in the context of alcohol-related research. 

Gap in the Literature: 

As previously stated, the aforementioned studies relied heavily on single-point summaries, indicating the EEGs overall shape, how it rises and falls and fluctuates over time is being ignored. Basing it off factors such as peak amplitude or means can be seen as a major limitation. For example two participants may have the same peak value but show completely different signal patterns leading up and following this peak value. Traditional methods miss these key differences which left a gap for a study that utilises these time-based differences. 

Our Approach and Motivation:  

In these study, we aim to move beyond summary statistics and keep the entire time-based structure on the EEG signals we decided to focus on. We utilised Functional Data Analysis, to ensure each EEG trial was treated as a continuous curve rather than isolated points. FPCA allowed us to breakdown the EEG data into a set of shape-based components that kept the key patterns and differences. These components were later used to explore clustering too group similar patterns together and classification to predict a subject identifier (control or alcoholic).  

Research Aims and Questions: 

This project was guided by the following research questions: 

Do EEG patterns differ between alcoholics and controls? 

How do different visual stimuli (S1 – Object, S2 – Match, and S2 – No-Match) affect EEG signals? 

Can EEG curve shapes be used to group participants using clustering methods? 

Can we predict group membership (alcoholic or control) from EEG data using classification models?

2. Methods 

2.1 Data Description 

The dataset used throughout our studies was obtained from UCI Machine Learning Repository which was hosted on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nnair25/Alcoholics.  

This dataset contains 16 participants divided into two groups 8 alcoholics and 8 control subjects. Each participant undertook various trials where they were exposed to various visual stimuli while their brain activity was recorded by 64 electrodes. These electrodes were positioned on the scalp following the International 10 – 20 System. 

 

EEG signals were sampled at 256 Hz, which provides a datapoint at approximately every 3.9 milliseconds. The trials lasted one second and contained 265 time points per trial. The given data included multiple trials per multiple subject, however, for our study we focussed on the first trial from each participant for each stimuli to ensure consistency 

Visual Stimuli Conditions: 
Each participant was shown images from Snodgrass & Vanderwart standardised picture set (1980) under three different conditions. 

S1 Object: A single image presented from the picture set 

S2 Match: Two identical images presented sequentially from the picture set 

S2 No-Match: Two different images presented sequentially from the picture set 

The aim for these conditions was to test how the brain responds to visual repetition versus unexpected change. The S2 No-Match condition introduces an unexpected mismatch requiring increased processing which is expected to evoke a stronger cognitive response.  

Electrode Selection: 

Although data was recorded from all 64 electrode sensors, our analysis focused on two frontal electrodes in particular FP1 & FP2 (https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:EEG_10-10_system_with_additional_information.svg)  

A diagram of a brain

Description automatically generated, PictureThese electrodes were selected for our study as frontal brain regions are known the play a key role in attention, inhibition and cognitive function, all of which are often impaired with over consumption of alcohol or AUD. Focussing on these two frontal sensors allowed us to capture meaningful insight into the differences in brain function based off these domains, while reducing computational complexity. These electrodes are often focussed on in previous EEG & ERP studies investigating alcohol-related processing, making them theoretically and practically justified as focal points for our analysis.  
 

2.2 Pre-processing & Smoothing 

Before Analysis, the raw EEG signals underwent pre-processing to reduce noise and prepare for curve-based modelling. Originally, each trial recorded 256 discrete time points, subsequently, these points were smoothed into a continuous function using B-spline basis functions. This approach allowed us to treat these EEG signals as curves and extract meaningful patterns across a given time period. This smoothing process was a crucial step to prepare the data for later Functional Principle Component Analysis (FPCA), which relies on capturing overall shape and investigating key components. 

B-Spline Smoothing 

Initially, we applied B-spline basis functions to model the EEG signals as continuous functions. The smoothing parameter was chosen using cross-validation to strike a balance between overfitting and underfitting, ensuring enough flexibility to capture the underlying signal while avoiding noise. This process was essential for enabling FPCA later in the pipeline, which requires smooth, comparable functions. 

Fourier Smoothing 

Although B-splines provided reasonable approximations, we later adopted Fourier basis functions to better reflect the oscillatory and periodic nature of EEG signals. Fourier basis functions, built from sine and cosine waves, are particularly well suited for EEG data, which often display rhythmic patterns over time. 

Comparison of Basis Functions 

PictureVisual inspection (see Figure 2) showed both B-spline and Fourier smoothing yielded similar overall fits. However, Fourier smoothing produced more globally smooth and consistent wave-like curves, which may have contributed to improved model performance in prediction tasks. As a result, Fourier smoothing was used in our later modelling and FPCA stages.

2.3 Permutation Testing 
A central aim throughout this study was to determine whether statistically significant differences exist between the control and alcoholic participant’s EEG signals. Due to EEG data typically being high dimensional, non-normally distributed and noisy, traditional parametric statistical tests such as ANOVA & t-test are not appropriate in this context. To address this, we applied a permutation test. A permutation test is a non-parametric method that makes no assumptions about the underlying distribution of the data, which is far more reliable for this context. 

Rationale for Permutation Test:  

Throughout this study we utilised this test type to assess whether the observed differences between the subject identifier’s (alcoholic’s vs. control’s) average EEG curves were greater than what would be expected to occur by chance. This step is crucial for evaluating our first research question (Research Question 1) which asked whether EEG patterns differ between subject identifier groups.  

How it works:  

We initially focused on the FP1 electrode and ran the test separately for each of the three stimulus conditions (S1 obj, S2 Match and S2 No-Match) for condition group the steps are as follows: 
	1. Compute the Observed Test Statistic  

Calculate the pointwise differences in mean EEG curves between the two subject 		identifiers (alcoholic and controls). This gives a curve representing the observed 		group difference over time. 

2. Generate a null distribution 

Randomly shuffle the group labels (alcoholic/control) 1000 times, and with each 		shuffle recalculate the group difference to create a distribution of test statistics under 	the null hypothesis (in this case no group effect). 

3.Calculate a p-value 

We compared the observed test statistic to the null distribution. The p-value was 		defined as the proportion of permuted test statistics that were greater than or equal to 	the observed value. A low p-value (p < 0.05) indicates that the observed group 		difference is unlikely to have occurred by chance. 

Why This Approach is Appropriate: 

Permutation testing aligns well with the nature of EEG data. It not only avoids assumptions of normality but also respects the time-dependent structure of EEG curves, by retaining the full functional form of the EEG curves. It provides a distribution-free method for inference, increasing confidence in results derived from a modest sample size, such as ours (n = 16). 

 

2.4 Functional Data Analysis (FDA) 

Following the findings from permutation tests, which revealed meaningful group-level differences in EEG signal shape, particularly under the S2 No-Match condition. FDA provided a powerful way to preserve the temporal structure of the EEG signals and move beyond traditional methods that rely on single-point summaries like peak amplitude or mean response. 

Why Functional Data Analysis? 

Traditional EEG analysis methods often reduce signals to summary statistics such as peak amplitude or means. While these are informative, they discard a lot of the temporal information of the curve. They ignore the rich, time-varying structure of the data, masking important differences between groups. FDA retains the full shape of the curve, capturing how the signal rises, falls, and fluctuates over all time points. 

FDA allows us to represent each trial as a smooth function. This is important for identifying dominant patterns of variability over time and reduce noise through curve smoothing. FDA also gives a component for each curve which represents the key patterns of variation which assists in the Functional Principal Component Analysis. 

Smoothing and Basis Functions: 

Each raw EEG signal was recorded at 256 discrete time points over a one-second trial. To convert these into functional smoothed curves, we explored two different types of basis functions. 

B-Spline Basis Functions: 

Localised polynomial functions that are flexible and perform well when signals vary rapidly in certain time windows. These were initially used with cubic splines and tuning via cross-validation. 

Fourier Basis Functions: 

Built from sine and cosine waves, these are ideal for modelling periodic, rhythmic data, such as EEG signals. Fourier basis functions provide a more global and concise representation, particularly when the signal exhibits smooth, wave-like patterns. 

Comparison and Final Choice: 

Initially, we focused on cubic B-Splines for our analysis using cross-validation to avoid overfitting. However, upon further research we discovered Fourier basis functions. We found they offered a more interpretable and concise representation of the underlying EEG patterns, with fewer basis functions needed to capture the same signal complexity. 

After comparing both approaches, our final smoothing decision was to use Fourier basis functions with 7 basis elements in our FPCA. We found that this balanced model simplicity and curve integrity. Visual inspection of smoothed curves showed that Fourier-based representations offered more consistent reconstructions across participants and stimulus conditions. These comparisons supported the use of Fourier basis functions in the next stage of analysis. 

Preparing for Functional Principal Component Analysis	 

With each EEG signal now expressed as a smooth functional component, we can apply FPCA. This will allow us to extract key shape-based components from the data, revealing dominant modes of variability across subjects. This step marked the transition from signal representation to functional modelling, forming the backbone of the next analytical stages. 

 

2.5 Functional Principal Component Analysis (FPCA) 
After smoothing each EEG signal into a continuous functional curve using basis functions, we applied Functional Principal Component Analysis (FPCA) to identify dominant patterns/components of variation across the subjects.   

FPCA is a foundational tool in FDA, its approach is to break each subject’s EEG curve down into a mean function alongside a weighted sum of principal components (otherwise known as eigenfunctions or modes of variation). Each principal component helps capture a distinct shape feature in the data, such as changes in amplitude, timing and curvature. The scores assigned to each component for a given subject suggest how strongly that subjects signal expresses that key feature.  

How FPCA was used:  

FPCA was applied separately to FP1 and FP2 electrodes, for each trials smoothed EEG signal. We initially extracted 10 components per electrode, but retained the first 6 for further analysis, as these collectively explained the vast majority of variance. Specifically, the first three components typically covered over 90% of the total variance: 

PC1 typically captured overall amplitude differences. 

PC2 represented latency shifts (timing of peaks). 

PC3 captured more subtle, localised shape variations. 

Each EEG signal was thus represented by a vector of FPCA scores (e.g PC1 – PC6), this summarised their EEG signal shape in a low-dimensional but meaningful, informative way. These scores were subsequently used as input features for clustering and classification models. 
These FPCA scores formed the core feature set for subsequent clustering and classification modelling, allowing us to analyse EEG shape across participants without discarding critical temporal structure. 

2.6 Clustering 

Following the extraction of key shape-based features from FPCA, we employed unsupervised clustering to explore whether EEG signal shapes alone could reveal meaningful groupings among participant trials, particularly with respect to alcoholism status and stimulus type. 

Clustering Algorithm: K-Means 

We selected K-means clustering as our primary algorithm due to its simplicity, interpretability, and effectiveness in identifying compact, spherical clusters in multidimensional space. K-means partitions data into k groups by minimising the within-cluster sum of squares, assigning each observation to the nearest cluster centroid. 

While more complex algorithms could also be applied such as hierarchical clustering, we found K-means provided a conceptually clear and computationally efficient approach to explore the latent structure in the FPCA score space.  

Input Features 

The clustering was performed on the combined FPCA score matrix, which included the first six principal components from both FP1 and FP2 electrodes. These components represented the most important modes of variation in EEG signal shape and provided a low-dimensional summary of each participant's response. 

Each row in the input matrix corresponded to a participant-trial. 

Each column represented a principal component score, capturing variation in signal shape (e.g. amplitude, latency, waveform pattern). 

We retained only those components explaining substantial variance, ensuring the clustering was driven by meaningful differences. 

Combining FP1 and FP2 information allowed us to represent frontal brain activity comprehensively while preserving electrode-specific contributions. 

Determining the Number of Clusters 

To select the optimal number of clusters (k), we explored: 

Elbow plots: plotting total within-cluster variance across a range of k values to identify diminishing returns. 

Silhouette analysis: measuring how similar each observation is to its own cluster versus others. 

These diagnostics, along with theoretical considerations of task/stimulus types and expected heterogeneity, led us to focus on k = 3 as a meaningful partition of the data. 

Visualisation and Interpretation 

Once each trial was assigned to a cluster, we performed the following analyses to interpret the clustering structure: 

Visualise clusters in principal component space.  

Overlay clusters on raw EEG curves, coloured by membership, to examine whether clusters represented distinct waveform shapes. 

Compare cluster compositions with known group labels (alcoholic vs control) and stimuli, to evaluate whether natural groupings aligned with meaningful clinical or experimental categories. 

These visualisations allowed us to assess whether clusters reflected meaningful differences in EEG shape and whether they aligned with group status or stimulus condition, highlighting the potential of EEG curve features to reveal underlying structure without supervision. 

 

2.7 Classification Modelling 
Having established that EEG signal shape differs between alcoholics and controls through permutation testing, and that unsupervised clustering reveals latent structure in the data, we next explored whether these differences could be used to predict group membership. Specifically, we tested whether a participant’s alcoholism status could be predicted based on FPCA-derived features. 

To achieve this, we trained and compared multiple supervised classification models using the principal component scores as input features. 

Feature Set: FPCA Scores 

The input for all models was a feature matrix consisting of the first six principal component scores extracted via FPCA from FP1 and FP2 electrodes. These scores compactly represent the shape of each EEG curve, summarising its most important temporal features. 

Each row represented one trial, and the outcome variable was binary: 

1 = Alcoholic 

0 = Control 

To prevent overfitting and allow generalisation, we used a train-test split (70/30), and evaluated model performance on the unseen test set. 

1. Lasso Logistic Regression 

Rationale: 
 Lasso (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) is a penalised regression method that performs variable selection and regularisation. It is particularly well-suited to high-dimensional data like FPCA scores, where only a subset of features may be relevant. 

Implementation: 
 We applied Lasso logistic regression using 10-fold cross-validation to select the regularisation parameter (λ) that minimised classification error. 

Advantages: 

Automatically reduces less relevant FPCA components. 

Produces interpretable models by shrinking coefficients to zero. 

2. Random Forest 

Rationale: 
 Random Forest is a tree-based ensemble method that aggregates predictions from multiple decision trees, reducing variance and improving accuracy. It is non-parametric and can capture nonlinear interactions between predictors. 

Implementation: 
 We trained a Random Forest classifier using default parameters, tuning the number of trees and variables per split (mtry) based on out-of-bag error. 

Advantages: 

Robust to outliers and overfitting. 

Captures complex interactions between components. 

Provides variable importance metrics, indicating which PCs contributed most to prediction. 

3. Multinomial Logistic Regression 

Rationale: 
 Although our primary classification task is binary (alcoholic vs. control), we also considered stimulus condition (S1, S2 Match, S2 No-Match) as an outcome, allowing the use of multinomial logistic regression for exploratory purposes. 

Implementation: 
 We fitted a multinomial logit model using FPCA scores as predictors, and evaluated its performance on correctly classifying trials by stimulus condition. 

Advantages: 

Allows extension to multiclass problems. 

Provides a baseline comparison to more complex methods. 

 

Model Evaluation 

To assess the performance of our classification models, we assessed the following standard evaluation metrics: 

Accuracy: The proportion of correctly predicted labels out of the amount of predictions made. Used to give an overall sense of model performance. 

Sensitivity (True Positive Rate): The proportion of alcoholic participants correctly identified as alcoholics. This can be important for scenarios where filing to detect alcoholism is more detrimental than a false alarm. 

Specificity (True Negative Rate): The proportion of controls who were correctly classified as non-alcoholics. High specificity indicates the model is not producing false positives by identifying healthy individuals as alcoholic. We ensured to utilise confusion matrices to visualise the breakdown if true/false positives and negatives for each of the models. 

Picture This allowed us to interpret model performance in a more detailed way opposed to a single accuracy score. These metrics were calculated for each of the classifiers e.g. Random Forest, Lasso and Multinomial Logistic Regression, as well as each basis function (Fourier & B-Spline). This gave us the opportunity to efficiently compare their effectiveness in predicting group status from FPCA scores.

3. Results 

RQ1: Do EEG patterns differ between alcoholics and controls. 

This research question involved testing group-level differences, particularly in shape. 

To address RQ1, we plotted the mean EEG curves for both groups across each visual stimuli. 

 

PictureAs seen in Fig 4, the S2 No-Match condition shows the greatest divergence in EEG curve shape between groups. We began by plotting the mean EEG responses for alcoholics and controls across all stimulus types, which motivated a subsequent permutation test to assess statistical significance. 

Figure 4 

PictureThe permutation test for the S2 No-Match condition returned a p-value of 0.021, indicating a statistically significant difference between alcoholics and controls. As shown in Fig 5, the observed test statistic (red dashed line) lies in the extreme right tail of the null distribution, meaning such a result is unlikely to occur by chance.				Figure 5 

In contrast, the S1 and S2 Match conditions did not yield significant differences (p > 0.05), suggesting more similar neural responses between groups for simpler or repeated visual stimuli. 

These findings support the hypothesis that group-level differences are most pronounced under cognitively demanding conditions, like when unexpected stimuli are presented (S2 No-Match). 

 

 

 

 

RQ2: How do different visual stimuli affect EEG signals? 

This question helped us explore how the signal changes based on the stimuli type given to participants. 

PictureTo address Research Question 2, we examined how the shape of EEG signals varied across the three stimulus types — S1 Object, S2 Match, and S2 No-Match — which differ in levels of cognitive demand. 

Figure 6 

We began by plotting the average smoothed EEG curves for each condition across all participants. These curves were generated using B-spline smoothing, which we used in the earlier stages of the project. 

At this point in the analysis, Fourier basis had not yet been applied — we adopted Fourier later in the pipeline, particularly during FPCA and modelling stages. 

 

PictureFigure 7 shows that EEG responses to the S2 No-Match condition exhibited sharper peaks and greater amplitude, consistent with the increased cognitive effort required to process unexpected visual changes. 
 This suggests heightened neural activation when detecting novelty. 

Figure 7 

In contrast, the S2 Match condition showed flatter and more variable curves, indicating a wider range of brain responses across participants. 
 This variability may reflect the brain’s reduced engagement with repeated stimuli, leading to more diffuse and inconsistent signal patterns. 

These observations support the idea that stimulus type influences both the intensity and consistency of EEG responses. 

To quantify these shape differences, we next examined FPCA scores by stimulus type — plotting boxplots of PC1 and PC2 to capture how key temporal features varied across S1, S2 Match, and S2 No-Match. 

 

PictureFigure 8 shows FPCA score distributions for the first two principal components. 
 PC1 scores were higher for S1 Object and S2 No-Match, reflecting stronger average signal features in these conditions. 
 In contrast, S2 Match showed a dip in PC1 and a wider spread in PC2, suggesting that repetition led to less consistent waveform shapes across subjects. 

Figure 8 

Visual inspection of the PC1 distributions suggests a difference between stimulus types, particularly between S1 and S2 No-Match. Future work could formally test this using a Kruskal-Wallis test or similar non-parametric method. 

 

RQ3: Can EEG Curves Shape Be Used To Group Participants Using Clustering? 

Our aim for this question was to explore whether the shape of EEG signals alone could naturally group participants in a meaningful way, using subject identifiers and the matching conditions.  

After extracting the aforementioned FPCA scores, clustering was applied to see if the brain signal shapes alone could uncover natural groupings. This allowed us to explore whether similar EEG patterns emerge across all participants and identify whether clusters relate to matching condition (alcoholic/control) or subject identifier (stimulus type). 

We visualised the k-mean results utilising scatter lots of the first two principle components (PC1 & PC2). Each point representing a particioant-trial and coloured by assigned cluster. This allowed us to understand how similar EEG shapes grouped together based on their component scores. 

 

PictureThe cluster-specific stimulus composition mirrors the increasing cognitive demand across stimuli. This reinforces the idea that FPCA captures differences in EEG shape and timing that align with the psychological nature of the task (e.g., novelty or repetition). 

Figure 9 

 

 

 

 

 

Next we looked at what these clusters contained, uncovering whether they were mostly alcoholics or controls.  

PictureWhile not perfectly separated, the group composition across clusters shows that unsupervised clustering based on EEG shape features captures meaningful group-level differences. This supports the potential of FPCA features in identifying cognitive or neurological groupings without needing group labels.  

Figure 10 

These patterns suggest that EEG curve shapes alone can uncover meaningful differences in how participants respond to tasks/stimuli, despite knowing their group label or not.  

 

RQ 4: Can EEG Signal Shape Predict Alcoholism Status? 

PictureWe compared two smoothing bases (B-spline and Fourier) combined with two classifiers: LASSO and Random Forest (RF). Each was evaluated using three performance metrics: Accuracy, Sensitivity, and Specificity. (As seen in Figure 11) 

Figure 11 

Key Findings: 

Fourier + Random Forest outperformed all others, with the highest accuracy (~88%), sensitivity, and specificity. 

B-spline + RF performed second best but slightly below Fourier in all metrics. 

LASSO showed relatively lower performance across both basis types, especially under Fourier, suggesting it may underfit this type of high-dimensional functional data. 

Why Fourier Performs Better: 

Fourier smoothing better preserves wave-like oscillatory structure in EEG signals. 

This likely improves feature representation, enabling Random Forest to more effectively distinguish between alcoholic and control subjects. 

Takeaway: 
 Using Fourier basis significantly improved predictive performance, especially with ensemble methods like Random Forest. 

Confusion Matrix Interpretation 

We visualised confusion matrices for both models (LASSO and Random Forest) using heatmaps. These show how many alcoholic/control participants were correctly or incorrectly classified. 

LASSO: 

Tended to misclassify alcoholics as controls more frequently. 

Shows less separation power between groups. 

Random Forest: 

Achieved higher counts along the diagonal (true positives and true negatives). 

More balanced sensitivity and specificity, indicating better generalisation. 

Insight: Random Forest not only achieved higher accuracy but also avoided group imbalance. It was more consistent across both alcoholic and control predictions. 

Final Graphical Interpretation 

The graphical outputs presented throughout this analysis demonstrate that EEG signals, when treated as functional data, yield valuable insight into cognitive processes and group differences. The mean EEG curves revealed that the S2 No-Match condition produced the strongest, most defined responses, consistent with the increased cognitive effort associated with detecting unexpected stimuli. 

This observation was statistically validated via permutation testing, which identified significant differences between alcoholic and control groups, particularly under the S2 No-Match condition. The FPCA boxplots further illustrated how key components (PC1 and PC2) varied systematically with stimulus type, with PC1 capturing amplitude-related differences and PC2 reflecting variability in temporal signal structure. 

Clustering analysis on FPCA scores uncovered coherent structure in the data: certain clusters were more likely to contain alcoholics or controls, and others were dominated by specific stimulus conditions. This suggests that signal shape alone, even without group labels captures meaningful variation in participant responses. 

Lastly, predictive modelling using Lasso and Random Forests confirmed that these FPCA-derived scores are informative features, achieving strong classification performance. Notably, models using the Fourier basis consistently outperformed those using B-splines, likely due to their ability to better preserve oscillatory EEG structure. 

Collectively, the graphical analyses highlight the power of FDA to extract interpretable, discriminative features from high-dimensional EEG data, enabling both statistical inference and predictive modelling in a cognitively meaningful way.

4. Discussion 

This study set out to investigate whether EEG signal shape could distinguish between alcoholic and control participants using Functional Data Analysis (FDA). By treating each EEG signal as a continuous function and applying Functional Principal Component Analysis (FPCA), we uncovered meaningful shape-based differences, particularly under cognitively demanding stimuli. Our results are discussed below in relation to each research question. 

RQ1: Do EEG patterns differ between alcoholics and controls? 

We found significant group-level differences in EEG responses, particularly under the S2 No-Match condition. The permutation test confirmed that the divergence in curve shape between alcoholic and control participants was unlikely to occur by chance (p = 0.021). This finding suggests that alcoholics exhibit altered neural processing when faced with unexpected stimuli, consistent with theories of impaired cognitive flexibility in AUD. 

This result aligns with previous ERP literature, particularly studies on the P300 component. Prior work has shown that alcoholics often display reduced P300 amplitudes in oddball tasks, indicating attenuated attentional engagement and stimulus evaluation (Polich et al., 1994; Porjesz & Begleiter, 2003). Our functional approach complements and extends this literature by retaining the full shape of the EEG waveform rather than focusing on a single latency or peak. 

RQ2: How do different visual stimuli affect EEG signals? 

Our results demonstrated that EEG responses varied systematically across stimulus types. The S2 No-Match condition, designed to introduce cognitive conflict,  elicited the strongest, most structured responses, while S2 Match (a repetition) generated flatter and more variable EEG signals. This is consistent with the expected hierarchy of cognitive demand: repetition (S2 Match) evokes less engagement, while novelty (S2 No-Match) requires heightened processing. 

The boxplots of FPCA scores by stimulus type revealed that PC1 (associated with amplitude) was highest for S2 No-Match, while PC2 (timing/variability) was most dispersed for S2 Match. These differences highlight how shape-based components of the EEG curve change under different cognitive loads. 

RQ3: Can EEG shape be used to group participants? 

Unsupervised clustering on FPCA scores produced meaningful groupings. Some clusters were enriched for alcoholics or controls, while others appeared linked to specific stimulus conditions. This suggests that EEG shape alone, without knowing participant labels, contains enough information to reveal latent structure related to cognitive traits or neurological status. These findings support the value of FPCA scores as compact, interpretable summaries of brain activity. 

RQ4: Can we predict alcoholism status from EEG data? 

Yes. Our classification models using FPCA scores from FP1 and FP2 achieved high accuracy, particularly when using Fourier smoothing and Random Forests (accuracy ~88%). This suggests that time-domain signal shape, captured through FDA, is a strong predictive feature for group classification. The superior performance of Fourier over B-spline likely reflects its ability to capture the rhythmic, oscillatory nature of EEG. 

This approach goes beyond traditional ERP measures by using a richer summary of the signal and retaining information across the full time window. It shows promise for EEG-based screening tools or cognitive profiling in clinical contexts.

5. Limitations and Future Work  

Limitations 

Sample Size: Our dataset included only 16 participants (8 per group), limiting statistical power and generalisability. While FDA methods are robust for small n, larger datasets would allow for more stable model estimation and validation. 

Trial Restriction: We focused on a single trial per stimulus per participant to ensure consistency. However, this may omit important intra-individual variability. 

Sensor Selection: Although we focused on FP1 and FP2 for theoretical and practical reasons, other electrodes (e.g., parietal or occipital regions) may capture complementary information, especially for ERP components like P300. 

Simplified Modelling: Our modelling used only FPCA scores from frontal sites and relatively standard classifiers. More complex architectures or incorporating additional features may yield better performance. 

Future Directions 

Multi-trial Functional Modelling: Incorporate repeated measures using functional mixed-effects models to account for within-subject variation. 

Expand Sensor Coverage: Explore full-scalp FPCA to detect spatial patterns in addition to temporal ones. 

Temporal Localisation: Combine FPCA with time-frequency decomposition to detect when during the trial group differences emerge. 

Real-time Prediction: Investigate the use of FPCA in online EEG decoding and early detection of cognitive impairment. 

Broader Populations: Apply this framework to other populations (adolescents, older adults, or clinical cohorts) to test robustness and generalisability.

6. Conclusion  

This study applied Functional Data Analysis (FDA) to EEG signals in order to explore group-level differences between alcoholic and control participants and evaluate whether signal shape could be used for classification and clustering. By treating EEG data as smooth functional curves and extracting key shape-based components using Functional Principal Component Analysis (FPCA), we were able to preserve and interpret the rich temporal dynamics of neural activity. 

Our results revealed several key findings: 

Significant group differences were detected in EEG shape, particularly under the S2 No-Match stimulus condition, where alcoholic participants exhibited distinct temporal patterns compared to controls. 

Different stimulus types elicited distinct EEG responses, with S2 No-Match producing stronger and more consistent signals, likely reflecting heightened cognitive processing demands. 

Unsupervised clustering using FPCA scores revealed groupings that partially aligned with alcoholism status and stimulus condition, suggesting that signal shape carries meaningful structure even without labels. 

Predictive models using FPCA scores from FP1 and FP2 electrodes achieved strong classification performance, especially when Fourier basis functions and Random Forests were used. 

These findings demonstrate the value of functional representations for analysing complex, high-dimensional time series data like EEG. FDA methods not only preserve important curve features but also produce interpretable summaries that support clustering and classification tasks. This approach offers a promising direction for identifying neural markers of cognitive dysfunction and could be extended to other domains within health data science. 

Future work should expand this analysis to larger datasets, multiple trials, and additional electrodes, while exploring more advanced predictive architectures. Nevertheless, this study provides an important step toward using functional signal shape to understand and predict cognitive and neurological status.
